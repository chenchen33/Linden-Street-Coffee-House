#Linden Street Coffee House


Linden Street Coffee House is the No. 1 coffee house in Lamoni, serving people in town and students at Graceland University. Parents who came to the school to visit their children would choose Linden Street Coffee House to sit down and talk. Friends with ages came to this place to find memories. A lot more just got the habit to come to Linden Street Coffee House to grab a cup of coffee to start their day.

In the Electronic Commerce class I took this year, I did several projects for local business, including designing and developing a website for Linden Street Coffee Hourse. This website is targeted on the local neighborhood. So the main page is simple with clear navigation, and warm dark tone. The slide show presents the highlight of the coffee house, including new food they developed, activities that will be taken place in the near future, and other news. Below the slide show comes the featured food, which will direct the customer to the menu. Featured activities are also presented for neighborhood, which link to the photo gallery. Below the main page comes the footer that has a sign-up box and social media buttons which links to other information portal of this local business. A large high-definition featured picture was used as the background of layout.

As the names in the navigation bar indicate, every tab links to the corresponding page. For instance, the menu link will lead the user to the featured menu page shown in the above picture. The coffee house has more than just coffee so I took drinks and sandwiches as two example divisions. The menu was implemented as a slider when customers click on a thumbnail, big high-resolution picture with review will pop up.
