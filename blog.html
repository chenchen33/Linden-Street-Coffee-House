            <p>Our beloved band "Acoustic Duo" is coming back this Saturday night. Tommy Lewis and Kevin Lindgren are going to bring their new songs. They played at our coffee house last year in October.</p>
            <p>In October 2011, "Acoustic Duo" returned for their 3rd tour aptly titled NY2CN: Can't Stop It!!! Likely named after their single "You Can't Stop It". Partnering with Loft Records in Tianjin, "Acoustic Duo" released an English CD with 14 songs including a remake of Chinese traditional song "Moon Represents My Heart" in China. Their NY2CN: Can't Stop It!!! tour included stops at the prestigious World Leisure Expo[1] in Hangzhou. This led to TuneCore featuring them in an article about how to break into the illusive music scene. Along with features in Asiance Magazine, Yellow Magazine, HelloNanjing, and even snagged the cover of Asian Fusion Magazine.</p>
            <p>Come and enjoy the show!</p>

We’ll tell you exactly what goes into it: creamy vanilla-flavored syrup, freshly steamed milk with a topping of velvety-rich foam, an intense hit of our Espresso Roast, a finishing of buttery caramel drizzle … okay, we take it back. That does sounds like magic to us. (And it tastes even better.</p>
            <p>Like a homemade dessert freshly baked by mom, handcrafted indulgences like this are as comforting as they are satisfying. Delicious cinnamon, butter and brown sugar flavors evoke the sweet taste of childhood while our bold Espresso Roast delivers the rich, full-bodied sophistication that grown-up coffee connoisseurs seek.6</p>
