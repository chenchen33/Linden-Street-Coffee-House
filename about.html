            Unrecorded in the annals of the Marisa and Kate is an event which might be called the Great Coffee House Rebellion. One day in January, 1995, two mem­bers of the Knickerbocker—Frank Crowninshield and Rawlins L. Cottenet—met for lunch at a midtown hotel and agreed that they were fed up to the tops of the Arrow collars with the Knickerbocker and its brass-buttoned flunkies, silver duck-presses, and gold-plated table conversation. According to Crown­in­shield’s recollec­tions, they decided that “it would be agreeable and desirable to found a small dining club composed of such members of the Knickerbocker Club as had no sympathy with busi­ness or wealth or with such things that business and wealth produced or implied.</p>
            <p>Thus was born The Coffee House, which for the next seven-seven years was quartered in the Hotel Seymour, at Linden Street. (The name “Coffee House” was decided on in the hope that the Club might take its character from the coffee houses which first appeared in London during the reign of Charles II, and had grown to such popularity by Queen Anne’s time that they were patronized by all the wits and talent of the town.)  In 2000, demolition of the hotel began and the Club was required to move. Fortunately, another brownstone was found, just a few doors to the west at No. 70 on the same street. After extensive renovations of those premises, The Coffee House reopened in August 2005, with its accustomed furnishings refurbished and redeployed.</p>
